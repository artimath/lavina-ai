# Lavina AI

## Project Overview
Lavina AI is a cutting-edge serverless application built on Cloudflare Workers, designed to provide a versatile and efficient API with advanced routing capabilities. It aims to simplify the development of complex web applications by offering powerful features such as redirection, proxying, and AI integration, all while leveraging the global distribution and scalability of Cloudflare's network.

## Key Features
- **Intelligent Routing**: Utilizes itty-router for efficient request handling and API endpoint management.
- **Flexible Redirection**: Implements a customizable redirection system accessible via the `/redirect` endpoint.
- **Secure Proxying**: Offers a robust proxying functionality through the `/proxy` endpoint, allowing for content modification and secure data transfer.
- **AI Integration**: Seamlessly incorporates Cloudflare's AI capabilities, enabling advanced machine learning tasks directly within the application.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Leverages Cloudflare Workers for a truly serverless deployment, ensuring high availability and automatic scaling.

## Code Review and Highlights

### 1. Modular Router Implementation
**File**: `broad-water-de89/src/index.ts`
```typescript
import apiRouter from './router';

// ...

if (url.pathname.startsWith('/api/')) {
    return apiRouter.handle(request);
}
```
This implementation demonstrates a clean separation of concerns by using a dedicated router for API requests, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

### 2. AI Binding Configuration
**File**: `wrangler.toml`
```toml
[ai]
binding = "AI"
```
This configuration showcases the project's integration with Cloudflare's AI capabilities, opening up possibilities for advanced machine learning tasks within the application.

### 3. Smart Build and Development Scripts
**File**: `package.json`
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev-html": "vite serve www",
  "dev-worker": "vite build && wrangler pages dev --live-reload",
  "build": "vite build"
}
```
These scripts demonstrate a sophisticated development setup, allowing for efficient HTML development and Worker testing with live reloading.

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: Primary programming language
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless platform for deployment
- **itty-router**: Lightweight routing library
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Wrangler**: Cloudflare Workers CLI tool
- **Hono**: Web framework for Cloudflare Workers (as a dependency)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lavina-ai.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   pnpm run dev-worker
   ```
4. For HTML development:
   ```
   pnpm run dev-html
   ```

## Usage
After starting the development server, you can access the following endpoints:
- Redirection: `/redirect?redirectUrl=https://example.com/`
- Proxying: `/proxy?modify&proxyUrl=https://example.com/`
- API: `/api/todos`

Example:
```
curl http://localhost:8787/api/todos
```
